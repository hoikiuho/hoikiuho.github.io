      <h1>The Olympian Gods</h1
        <p>There are <strong>twelve</strong> Olympian Gods. They are the so-called major deities amongst the greek gods.</p>
      <h2>List of the Olympian Gods</h2>
        <p>Are below for your reference, in the order they were born. (Hades was not counted as an Olympian god.)</p>
        <p>After Zeus, it won't definitive about who was born first, because they are the second generation, but I'll try my best.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Aphrodite (risen from Ouranos' ichor and sea foam)</li>
        <li>Hestia (some say that Hestia gave her throng to Dionysus, depending on the myth)</li>
        <li>Demeter</li>
        <li>Hera</li>
        <li>Poseidon</li>
        <li>Zeus</li>

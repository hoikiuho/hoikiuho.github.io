      <h1>Mount Olympus</h1>
    <p>Mount Olympus is the home of the Greek Gods and other creatures.</p>
    <p>So I have put the creatures and gods you would see on Mount Olympus and the view of Olympus on this page.</p>
      <h2>The Twelve Olympian Gods</h2>
      <p>Are listed below for your reference, in the order they were born. (Hades was not counted as an Olympian god.)</p>
      <p>After Zeus, it won't definitive about who was born first, because they are the second generation, but I'll try my best.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Aphrodite (risen from Ouranos' ichor and sea foam)
        <li>Hestia (some say Hestia gave her throne to Dionysus, depending on the myth)</li>
        <li>Demeter</li>
        <li>Hera</li>
        <li>Poseidon</li>
        <li>Zeus</li>
        <li>Athena</li>
        <li>Ares</li>
        <li>Apollo</li>
        <li>Artemis</li>
        <li>Hephaestus</li>
        <li>Hermes</li>
      </ol>
